- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @NicoNghiem
I'm a technical artist interested in everything that is high-dimensional geometry and all the mathematics/computer sciences that could help me make fancy pictures. I used to focus in crowds and animation but in my free time I am mostly learning about computational geometry.
